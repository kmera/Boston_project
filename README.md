## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Using Boston Airbnb Open Data from Sept 2016 to Sept 2017, the goal of this project is to answer three business 

1. What is the cost variation for homestays in Boston?
2. How neighborhood and review scores rating relate with each other?
3. What are the rules, facilities and room type most offered?

* Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
* Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
* Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook 

are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.
